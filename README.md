# UnityTutorial SpaceShooter

This project contains the completed game from following Unity's Space Shooter tutorial.
Note that there are comments in some of the scripts related to reminding myself what the different functions were, as I am using this to learn.

## Acknowledgements

All assets were obtained from downloading the Space Shooter tutorial package from Unity3d.com and the code scripts were created by following
the instructions in the accompanying tutorial videos.
